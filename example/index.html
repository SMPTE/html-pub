    <h2>SMPTE JSON structures</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Overview (informative)</h3> 
      The JSON Schema resource applicable to a JSON structure can specify constraints to which the structure is expected to conform.
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h3>SMPTE JSON Structures</h3>
      
      <p>
        A <dfn>SMPTE JSON structure</dfn> is any data structure that (a) is specified by an
        Engineering Document and (b) conforms to <a
        href="#bib-ietf-rfc-8259"></a> (i.e., a JSON document), whether within
        the prose or as an Additional Element.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The structure of each <a>SMPTE JSON structure</a> shall be normatively specified
        the Engineering Document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each SMPTE JSON structure should be informatively specified by a JSON Schema
        resource, which may be a SMPTE JSON Schema resource (see section 5), using
        the JSON Schema language as specified in <a href="#bib-draft-bhutton-json-schema-00"></a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Encoding</h3>
      
      <p>A SMPTE JSON structure is encoded using UTF-8 and does not include a
      byte order mark (BOM), as specified in <a
      href="#bib-ietf-rfc-8259"></a>.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Example Instances</h3>
      
      <p>All example instance JSON structures shall be informative.</p>
      
      <p>All example instance SMPTE JSON structures shall be valid with respect to
      the corresponding SMPTE JSON Schema resource, where one is provided.</p>
      
      <p>If a SMPTE JSON Schema resource is provided, it should be used to
      validate each corresponding example instance SMPTE JSON structure, as a test
      of both the instance and the resource.</p>
    </section>
    
  </section>

<section>
  <h2>SMPTE JSON Schema resources</h2>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Introduction (informative)</h3>
    
    <p>Using the formal language of JSON Schema, descriptions of conformance
    requirements for JSON structures can avoid some of the ambiguity inherent with
    using English prose alone, while allowing the use of existing commercial tools
    to facilitate testing and validation. It can also represent a significant
    convenience to implementers, for example by supporting the ability to
    automatically validate structures.</p>
    
    <p>A JSON Schema resource is identified by its canonical URI. Canonical URIs
    provide an unambiguous and human-readable link to the specifications define
    these schemas.</p>
    
    <p>Where a JSON Schema resource relies on another JSON Schema resource to
    specify constraints on substructures, the other JSON Schema is identified by its
    canonical URI.  </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Canonical URI</h3>
    
    <section id="sec-id-keyword">
      <h4><code>$id</code> Keyword</h4>
      
      <p>A SMPTE JSON Schema resource shall use the <code>$id</code> keyword in the root schema
      object, thereby providing the canonical URI for the JSON root schema.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h4>Canonical URI Syntax</h4>
      
      The canonical URI shall conform to the <code>SCHEMAID</code> syntax below,
      specified using <a href="#bib-ietf-rfc-5234"></a> and <a
      href="#bib-ietf-rfc-7405"></a> and conforming to <a
      href="#bib-ietf-rfc-3986"></a>.
      
<pre>
SCHEMAID = %s"https://www.smpte-ra.org/json-schema/" PUBNUM "/" REVISION [ "/" SHORTNAME]
SHORTNAME = 1*4("/" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" / ".") )
PUBNUM = 1*(DIGIT) ["-" 1*(DIGIT)]
REVISION = STABLEREV
STABLEREV = 4(DIGIT) [2(DIGIT)]
</pre>
      
      <p><code>PUBNUM</code> shall represent the official publication number of the
      Engineering Document, without leading zeroes and including a part number, if
      any, separated by a hyphen, e.g., 456-1.</p>
      
      <p><code>SHORTNAME</code> is used when the Engineering Document defines more
      than one JSON Schema. It may provide a human meaningful designation of the
      schema, but shall not include any version information.</p>
      
      <p>A stable SMPTE JSON Schema canonical URI is a SMPTE JSON Schema
      canonical URI whose name is such that <code>REVISION</code>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>conforms to <code>STABLEREV</code>, which consists of a year encoded as 4 decimal
        digits, optionally followed by a month encoded as 2 decimal digits in the
        range 01-12; and</li>
        <li>represents the date that the JSON Schema canonical URI first appeared in
        the Engineering Document, which might be as a Public Committee Draft.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="note">The <code>REVISION</code> component of a stable SMPTE JSON
      Schema canonical URI does not necessarily correspond to the publication
      date of its defining Engineering Document. For instance, the defining
      Engineering Document can be revised in such a way that the contents of the
      JSON Schema remain unchanged.</p>
      
      <p class="note">
        No changes to SMPTE JSON Schema canonical URI are necessary following a Draft
        Publication ballot since SMPTE JSON Schema canonical URI are constructed
        independently of the publication date of the Engineering Document.
      </p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h4>Examples (informative)</h4>
      The following is an example SMPTE JSON Schema resource canonical URI:
      
      <pre>https://www.smpte-ra.org/json-schema/456/2021/foo</pre>
      
      <p>One can immediately see that the schema "foo" is defined in a SMPTE
      Engineering Document numbered "456" and initially appeared in the year "2021".
      One would assume that a "foo" was a well-known artifact to SMPTE members, at
      least for those that have read Engineering Document number "456". </p>
      
      <p>The following is an example SMPTE JSON Schema resource canonical URI, defined
      in a document with a part designation and that originally appeared in September
      of 2022:</p>
      
      <pre>https://www.smpte-ra.org/json-schema/456-1/202209/foo</pre>
      
      <p>The following is a SMPTE JSON Schema resource canonical URI defined in a
      draft version of the same specification:</p>
      
      <pre>https://www.smpte-ra.org/json-schema/456-1/experimental-20211001/foo</pre>
      
      <p>The following is not equivalent to the previous name since it is missing the
      string "www" (though the two URIs can nevertheless resolve to the same resource
      when used in an HTTP GET query):</p>
      
      <pre>https://smpte-ra.org/json-schema/456-1/experimental-20141001/</pre>
      
      <p>The following is not a valid SMPTE JSON Schema resource canonical URI,
      since a fragment is used:</p>
      
      <pre>https://www.smpte-ra.org/json-schema/456-1/experimental-20141001/foo#hello</pre>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h4>Registration (informative)</h4>
      
      <p>
        The SMPTE JSON Schema resource canonical URI syntax ensures uniqueness across
        Engineering Documents, and thus no specific registration steps are required.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Change Policy</h3>
    
    An Engineering Document that defines a SMPTE JSON Schema resource should specify
    whether the schema is mutable, i.e., whether the schema is allowed to change
    substantially over time without also changing the canonical URI of the SMPTE
    JSON Schema resource.
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Using a SMPTE JSON Schema Resource</h3>
    
    <p>A SMPTE JSON Schema resource can be used informatively by an Engineering
    Document, either by inclusion or by reference.</p>
    
    <p class="note">The current specification of JSON Schema, though well-supported, is not a
    normatively referenceable document per the Standards Operations Manual (section
    10 Normative References) and AG-03. Thus, provision of SMPTE JSON Schema
    resources, at this time, is strictly informative.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Precedence</h3>
    
    <p>
      Engineering Documents normatively describe the constraints on a SMPTE JSON
      structure, including names and values, by their prose. Any Engineering Document
      providing a SMPTE JSON Schema resource to help validate a structure against
      those constraints should point out that, in case of a conflict between prose and
      the JSON Schema resource, the prose takes precedence.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Avoiding Discrepancies</h3>
    
    <p>
      To help avoid discrepancies between the English prose and a SMPTE JSON Schema
      resource, prose sections should be bound to the related portion of the resource,
      so that one cannot be modified without the other.
    </p>
    
    <p class="note">
      One method to bind prose to a SMPTE JSON Schema resource is to include the
      resource definitions inline within the prose. Another method is for the prose to
      refer to SMPTE JSON Schema resources specified in appendices or Additional
      Elements.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Any Additional Element that duplicates a SMPTE JSON Schema resource specified in
      the Prose Element, shall be informative.
    </p>
    
    <p class="note">
      Informative JSON Schema resource definitions can be provided as examples, e.g.,
      to demonstrate how to define an extension to another JSON Schema resource
      through the “additionalProperties” or “additionalItems” keywords.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="sec-version">
    <h3>Version</h3>
    
    <p>
      Whenever a SMPTE JSON Schema resource is provided, the Engineering Document
      shall provide an informative reference to the JSON Schema language specification
      to which it conforms (e.g., JSON Schema, as shown in the Bibliography).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A SMPTE JSON Schema resource shall use the <code>$schema</code> keyword in the root schema
      object.
    </p>
    
    <p class="note">
      the <code>$schema</code> keyword is both used as JSON Schema dialect identifier and
      as the identifier of a resource which is itself a JSON Schema resource to
      evaluate conformance to that dialect.
    </p>
    
    <p class="note">
      JSON Schema resources can comprise subschemas, where portions of a root
      schema document are separately identifiable by a URI-reference that are not
      absolute and/or contain non-empty fragments.  For example,
      <code>https://smpte-ra.org/schemas/2120-2/2021/smpte-tlx-items/definitions/rationalType</code>
      is a reference to a subschema within the SMPTE JSON Schema resource
      https://smpte-ra.org/schemas/2120-2/2021/smpte-tlx-items where the subschema
      represents the constraints for a JSON structure representing a rational value.
    </p>
    
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>External Definitions</h3>
    
    <p>
      The defining document of any externally-defined JSON Schema resource shall be
      included as an informative reference.
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Valid Definitions</h3>
    
    <p>
      All SMPTE JSON Schema resources specified in an Engineering Document shall be
      valid with respect to the JSON Schema resource(s) identified by the value of the
      <code>$schema</code> keyword(s) therein.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      All SMPTE JSON Schema resources should be validated against the meta-schema
      specified by their <code>$schema</code> keyword(s).
    </p>
  </section>
  
  <section>
    <h3>Publication</h3>
    
    All Additional Elements of Engineering Documents conforming to JSON Schema shall
    be publicly retrievable at an HTTP URI chosen by the Director of Engineering.
  </section>
  
  <section id="sec-keyword-order">
    <h3>Keyword Order</h3>
    
    <p>The following keywords should appear as the first keywords in any SMPTE JSON Schema resource in this order:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>$schema,</code> as specified in <a href="#sec-version"></a></li>
      <li><code>$id,</code> as specified in <a href="#sec-id-keyword"></a>; and,</li>
      <li><code>$comment,</code> as specified in <a
